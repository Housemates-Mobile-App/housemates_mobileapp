# Housemates: Team 6
Swift Mobile Application for housekeeping efficiency, collaboration, and organization.

Housemates is a way for people of the same living space, whther roomates, family, or large living communities to organized chores and tasks.

The main features of the app include:

- Post Feed: Features a optional before photo and required after photo of a chore.  Housemates can then react and comment on your posts and notifications are stored as well.  This increases communication and accountability

- Task Board: Add a Task, claim a task and complete a task.  Simple as that!

- Leaderboard:  See the statistical standings of the group.  Who contributes the most?

- Profile View:  See your previous activity and posts in a convienient calendar view.


Tech Decisions: 
We decided to use Firestore as a database to manage all real time data

Technical issues:
- When logging in, you may encounter an app crash or stall due to concurrent firebase processes.  Please exit the app on your local device and restart if this happens and it should be good to go!  Do the same if no data renders or unlimited buffering.
